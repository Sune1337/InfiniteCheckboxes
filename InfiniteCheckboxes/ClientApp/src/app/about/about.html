      <h2>Check and uncheck</h2>
      <p>
        It's all about checking or unchecking boxes. There's a global counter that keeps track of the total number of checked boxes.
        Let's see if we can beat 'onemillioncheckboxes'! <a routerLink="/Checkboxes">Start checking</a>

      <h2>Gold-digger</h2>
      <p>
        Hidden through out the site there's gold! When you find gold your user gets credited and of course you want as much gold as possible!
        Can you be #1 on the high-score list?
      </p>

      <h2>WAR!</h2>
      <p>
        This is a mini-game with a smaller map. (8x8 checkboxes). Compete with all other visitors to either check or uncheck all boxes.
        Since it's a small map there's actually a possibility to finish :) <a routerLink="/War">Go to WAR!</a>

      <h2>Why?</h2>
      <p>
        I have been wanting to experiment with writing distributed systems for a while.
        Inspired by 'onemillioncheckboxes' I found it a good example to use.
        But to add some complexity and justify a distributed system I decided to make it a bit bigger; so this version manages 2^256 * 4096 checkboxes!

      <p>
        Being a long-time .Net developer I've had my eyes on Orleans.Net for a while but only used it without it's cluster-capabilities.
        Orleans.Net is a virtual actor framework and that's a good fit to manage more data than possible.
        None the 2^256 pages of checkboxes actually exist until someone makes a change to them.

      <ul>
        <li>.Net 9</li>
        <li>Orleans.net - cluster framework</li>
        <li>Redis - Manages pub/sub</li>
        <li>SignalR - Realtime communication with clients</li>
        <li>MongoDB - DB used to store state</li>
        <li>Angular - UI framework</li>
      </ul>

      Everything is deployed to a Kubernetes cluster.
